# ML-API_endpoint

## Introduction

This repository offers a comprehensive guide for developing a FastAPI-based endpoint to facilitate querying a machine-learning prediction model. While this solution may not be suitable for deployment in production environments due to the absence of a secure HTTPS protocol, a token has been implemented to ensure adequate protection for pre-production usage. The codebase has been thoughtfully structured into Docker containers, facilitating seamless deployment across various testing and cloud environments.
By leveraging the resources available through this repository, users can seamlessly streamline their machine-learning workflows and enhance the efficiency of their querying systems. The solution presents a powerful and robust FastAPI endpoint, allowing users to efficiently and effectively query their machine-learning models.
